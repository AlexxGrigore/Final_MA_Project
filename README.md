## Description

The following system recognizes the name of the video that is being recorded, if that video is included in our dataset.

## How to use the system

First you need to create a database that stores the feature descriptors of the videos from the dataset.

Follow the following steps:

1. Create a folder in the main project named 'database'
2. In that folder create a sqlite database named 'video.sqlite'. To do that in PyCharm, you select new, Data Source
   Path, and then set the name to 'video.sqlite'
3. Create a new folder in the main project named 'dataset' and paste the videos (the ones from Brightspace)
4. Run the main.py script (it will take a lot of time). We've have a drive link where you can just download the database and paste it in the 'database folder'
